VLART (a.k.a. effarrbee) is a set of python tools for running real-time data analysis at the VLA.

Not ready for prime time, but we're working on it...

Requirements:
-- sdmreader (github:caseyjlaw/sdmreader)
-- Peter's tasklib and casautil stuff (casapy-free casa; github/pkgw/pwkit)
-- rq (python-rq.org)
-- redis
-- pyinotify
-- probably more...
